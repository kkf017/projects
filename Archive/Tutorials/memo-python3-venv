sudo apt install python3-venv

Then create a virtual environment in your project directory like this:
	python3 -m venv .venv

Now activate your virtual environment by running:
	source .venv/bin/activate

This modifies your PATH environment variable to include .venv/bin/. Now you can install PyPI packages using 		pip into your virtual envirnoment (in this case .venv/), like this:
	pip install requests

If you don't want to activate and deactivate virtual environments, you can run pip and python directly from the virtual environment, like this:

$ .venv/bin/pip install requests
$ .venv/bin/python
>>> import requests
